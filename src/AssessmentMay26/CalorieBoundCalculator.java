	 * Instructions from your teacher:
One way to measure the amount of energy that is expended during exercise is to use metabolic equivalents (MET). 
Here are some METS for various activities:
- Running 6 MPH: 10 METS
- Basketball: 8 METS
- Sleeping: 1 MET
METS are given per minute.

The number of calories burned per minute may be estimated using the following formula:
cal = 0.0175 * MET * Weight in kilograms

Write a program that asks user to enter his weight in pounds, and then calculates and outputs the total number of calories burned for a  person who runs 6 MPH for 30 minutes, plays basketball for 30 minutes, and then sleeps for 6 hours. One kilogram is equal to 2.2 pounds. 
use (int)cal to round a double value.
Example:
 
output: Enter weight in pounds:
input: 150
output: Calories Burned: 1073

		    double cal = 0;
		    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		    System.out.println("Enter weight in pounds:");
		    weight = scan.nextDouble();
		    
		    int METRun = 10;
		    int METBasketBall = 8;
		    int METSleep = 1;
		    int time = 0;
		    
		    //if() {}
		      
		    
		    //cal = 0.0175 * MET * weight;
